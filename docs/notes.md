## TODO:
- Peter add stuff to tool list
- Peter start table/list of things that did/didnt work
    - tool
    - task you tried it on
    - how it worked (with evidence)
    - implication/generalization
- Sandy draft structure for non-technical tasks flowchart
    - explore tools for UI
- Sandy prototype a notebook / snippets for a task
    - Pick one of the tasks I included in mentorship outline to also get experience in a new task


## Options for where to go next
- Add notebooks/code snippets for certain tasks
    - Example datasets to use
    - If you were going to use this tool on a project, what would it look like to get started?
    - Will need to make sure we don't duplicate examples already in package docs. Focus on what's different when applying this to our kind of data, social science problems.
- Make a version of the tasks data framed around agnostic approach and targeted to non-technical collaborators. This can also be a proposal tool - answering these questions for a proposal will ground a NLP solution in theory more than most competitors.
    - what's your quetsion
    - what data do you have
        - is imbalanced?
        - security issues?
    - compute resources


## Worklow brainstorm
- What inputs does the collaborator need to bring to go thru this?
    - What data will you use
        - How will acquire it / have acquired it
        - Size
        - Is imbalanced? Prevalence of the thing you're looking for.
    - Project background
    - Movitation for applying NLP to problem
    - Can we apply the Chicago data maturity / organizational readiness scorecards somehow? Adapt to our
